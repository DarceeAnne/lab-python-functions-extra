    "- Copy and paste the functions you created earlier in the Jupyter Notebook into the functions.py file. Rename the functions to `get_unique_list_f, count_case_f, remove_punctuation_f, word_count_f`. Add the _f suffix to each function name to ensure that you're calling the functions from your file.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import function_file\n",
    "\n",
    "function_file.function_name()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Renaming functions during import: You can also rename functions during import using the as keyword. This is useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for the function in your code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from function_file import function_name as f\n",
    "\n",
    "f.function_name(arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which method you choose, make sure that the functions.py file is in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook, or else specify the path to the file in the import statement or by using `sys.path`.\n",
